# Creational Design Patterns

This repository contains examples and explanations of various Creational Design Patterns. Creational patterns are focused on the mechanism of creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

## Patterns Covered

- Singleton
- Prototype
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder

Each pattern has its own directory with the following contents:

- Implementation examples in Python
- Detailed explanation of the pattern
- Use case scenarios where the pattern is applicable

## Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### Contents

- `singleton.py`: Implementation of the Singleton pattern.
- `README.md`: Description and usage of the Singleton pattern.

## Prototype

The Prototype pattern is used to create duplicate objects while keeping performance in mind. It lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Contents

- `prototype.py`: Implementation of the Prototype pattern.
- `README.md`: Description and usage of the Prototype pattern.

## Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

### Contents

- `factory_method.py`: Implementation of the Factory Method pattern.
- `README.md`: Description and usage of the Factory Method pattern.

## Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Contents

- `abstract_factory.py`: Implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern.
- `README.md`: Description and usage of the Abstract Factory pattern.

## Builder

The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Contents

- `builder.py`: Implementation of the Builder pattern.
- `README.md`: Description and usage of the Builder pattern.
