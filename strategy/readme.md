# Strategy Pattern

## Overview

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable within that family.

## Definition

The Strategy Pattern involves three key components:
- **Strategy Interface**: This interface defines a common operation for all supported algorithms.
- **Concrete Strategies**: These classes implement the Strategy Interface, each providing a different implementation of the algorithm.
- **Context**: A class that maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to this object.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Easily add new strategies without altering the context or other strategies.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to a specific algorithm are confined to its own class.
- **Decoupling**: The Context and Strategy classes are loosely coupled, promoting modularity.
- **Ease of Testing**: Each strategy can be tested independently from the context and other strategies.

## Use Cases

Strategy Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- Multiple algorithms exist for a specific task.
- An algorithm needs to be selected and possibly changed at runtime.
- The system needs to be easily extendable with new algorithms without modifying existing code.
